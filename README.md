# Shopsmart

When visiting retail stores, shoppers today face a variety of challenges. While a shopper can use a simple Google Search to find the quantity and price for a single item, this task becomes tedious when it comes to a list of multiple items, as with a shopping list. The limitations and precautions taken to suppress the spread of the coronavirus have only exacerbated these difficulties. For example, to reduce the risk of transmission, local and major grocery chains have begun to limit the number of people that can enter stores at any given time.


Now more than ever, people need efficient shopping experiences. If we streamline this process of shopping for multiple items at once, a shopper will be better able to access the information they need before leaving the house. Shopsmart will help you save money and time by making more informed decisions about which stores to visit for your particular needs.
